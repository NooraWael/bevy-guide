# Bevy Game Development Guide

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive guide to game development with the Bevy engine. It's structured as a step-by-step tutorial that takes you from the basics to building a complete 3D ball game.

Created cuz I was bored and wanted to learn something new :D.

## Requirements
- Rust programming language
- Bevy engine (version 0.15+)

## Why I Created This
I created this guide because of my love for game development and to help others learn the Bevy engine, which I believe is one of the most exciting game engines for Rust developers.
